            <p class="font-weight-bold text-center text-danger">Currently Looking for Software/Web Development Job Roles</p>
            <p style="font-size: small;">As a double Masters of Science in both Advanced Computer Science and Big Data and Data Science Technology, with a bachelors graduate in Computer Science, I am keen on learning the vast world of different programming languages applied within the areas of Software and Web Development, while taking on modern and highly sought after languages. While coding, I maintain a stand on quality, functionality, and being attentive to detail, regardless of the drive to learn about different programming languages instead of specializing in one programming language.</p>
